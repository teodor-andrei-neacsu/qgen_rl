Industrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological
theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often
involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.
Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an
environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied
nature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,
2013).
